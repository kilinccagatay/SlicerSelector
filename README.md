3D Printing Slicer Selector for macOS

This is a simple AppleScript that allows you to choose your preferred slicer (e.g., Bambu Studio, PrusaSlicer, OrcaSlicer, or Creality Print) when opening .3mf or .stl files on macOS. Instead of manually opening slicer applications, this script provides a convenient way to select the slicer at the time of file opening.

Features

Custom Slicer Selection: Choose from a list of slicers when opening 3MF or STL files.
Easy to Customize: Modify the script to include additional slicers or change the default selection.
Streamlined Workflow: No need to open slicers manuallyâ€”save time and stay organized.
How It Works

Install the Script: Save the script as an application using Script Editor on macOS.
Open Your Files: When you double-click a .3mf or .stl file, the script will prompt you to choose a slicer from a predefined list.
Seamless Execution: The selected slicer automatically opens with your chosen file.
